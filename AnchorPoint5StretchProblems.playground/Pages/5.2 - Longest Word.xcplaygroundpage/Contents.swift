 ## Longest Word In String
 ### Instructions
 - Write a function that takes a string and returns the biggest word in that string.
 - Make sure to remove punctuation and whitespace.
 ```
 longestWord("This string, has a gigantic! word in it...") // returns "gigantic"
 
 longestWord("one, two, three") // returns "three"
 ```
  - Note: Look up `NSCharacterSet` methods to remove whitespace and punctuation. Create the charSets as `NSMutableCharset` objects so you can combine the two CharSets. Call the `componentsSeperatedByCharacterInSet` method on the parameter string to get an array of strings after separating them by the charSets. Loop through the array to check against your return string length.
